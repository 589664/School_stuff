\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This project was a good way to implement a very common IoT – device, that is not way to complicated. For our group every element of IoT – system was implemented and is currently running smoothly. Project gave better understanding of IoT – devices and how to implement REST API for similar systems and introduced powerful libraries and tools to do so. Part A of the project gives a good introduction to Ardruino that taught us beginner concept of wiring up a ACD system, and programming functionality  with C++ and extra libraries from Ardruino. All in all, a very learning project. That results in wider understanding of IoT – systems and more powerful set of tools to use for further projects.
